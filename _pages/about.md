I am Assistant Astronomer at the NSF National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory (<a href="https://noirlab.edu/science/">NSF NOIRLab</a>). I work in the US National Gemini Office (<a href="https://noirlab.edu/science/programs/csdc/usngo">US NGO</a>), which is a group within the Community Science and Data Center (<a href="https://noirlab.edu/science/programs/csdc/">CSDC</a>) at the NOIRLab.

My scientific interests are in stellar population, galaxy formation and evolution, and time domain astronomy, specially in the study of pulsating variable stars (such as RR Lyrae, Cepheids, delta Scuti, Miras) in Local Group dwarf galaxies and globular clusters. My main research is focused, in particular, on the use of variable stars as standard candles and as probes of the evolution of Local Group galaxies.

Previously, I was a staff of the Operations team at <a href="https://www.gemini.edu/"> Gemini Observatory </a> helping with phase II, observations, queue coordination, instruments checks (being directly involved with: <a href="http://www.gemini.edu/instrumentation/gmos">GMOS</a>, <a href="https://www.gemini.edu/instrumentation/graces">GRACES</a>, <a href="https://www.gemini.edu/instrumentation/niri">NIRI</a> and <a href="https://www.gemini.edu/instrumentation/maroon-x">MAROON-X</a>), and also member of the Fast Turnaround (<a href="https://www.gemini.edu/observing/phase-i/ft">FT</a>) team and of the Gemini Director Time Review Board. I was also postdoc at <a href="https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/ctio/">CTIO</a> and part of the scientific support team of the Dark Energy Camera (<a href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/noao/content/Dark-Energy-Camera-DECam"> DECam</a>) at the <a href="https://noirlab.edu/science/programs/ctio/telescopes/victor-blanco-4m-telescope">CTIO-4m Blanco telescope</a>.

I am a member of several international collaborations: <a href="https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/">DES</a> (The Dark Energy Survey), <a href="https://www.legacysurvey.org/decamls/">DECaLS</a> (The Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey), <a href="https://delve-survey.github.io/">DELVE</a> (The DECam Local Volume Exploration survey), <a href="https://lsst-tvssc.github.io/">LSST TVS SC</a> (Rubin LSST Transients and Variable Stars Science Collaboration), <a href="https://u.osu.edu/mpenny/2018/12/28/introducing-mishaps-the-multi-band-imaging-survey-for-high-alpha-planets/">MISHAPS</a> (The Multi-band Imaging Survey for High-Alpha PlanetS) and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014hst..prop13739S/abstract">ISLAndS</a> (Initial Star formation and Lifetimes of Andromeda Satellites) among them. But I am also involved in smaller ones that focus on galactic-archeology and on the study and characterization of variable stars in the Local Group galaxies and stellar clusters.
