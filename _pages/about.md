I am currently Science Fellow at <a href="https://www.gemini.edu/"> Gemini Observatory </a> in Hawai'i, a program of the NSF’s National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory <a href="https://nationalastro.org/">(NOIRLab)</a>. My scientific interests are in stellar population, galaxy formation and evolution, and time domain astronomy, specially in the study of pulsating variable stars (such as RR Lyrae, Cepheids, delta Scuti, Miras) in Local Group dwarf galaxies and globular clusters. My main research is focused, in particular, on the use of variable stars as standard candles and as probes of the evolution of Local Group galaxies.

Since Septermber 2021, I am part of the <a href="http://www.gemini.edu/instrumentation/gmos"> GMOS</a>, <a href="https://www.gemini.edu/instrumentation/graces"> GRACES</a>, <a href="https://www.gemini.edu/instrumentation/niri"> NIRI</a> support staff at Gemini Observatory, and during my postdoc at <a href="https://noirlab.edu/public/programs/ctio/">(CTIO)</a> I was part of the scientific support team of the Dark Energy Camera <a href="http://www.ctio.noao.edu/noao/content/Dark-Energy-Camera-DECam">(DECam)</a> at the CTIO-4m Blanco telescope.

I am a member of several international collaborations: <a href="https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/">DES</a> (The Dark Energy Survey), <a href="https://www.legacysurvey.org/decamls/">DECaLS</a> (The Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey), <a href="https://delve-survey.github.io/">DELVE</a> (The DECam Local Volume Exploration survey), <a href="https://lsst-tvssc.github.io/">LSST TVS SC</a> (Rubin LSST Transients ans Variable Stars Science Collaboration), <a href="https://u.osu.edu/mpenny/2018/12/28/introducing-mishaps-the-multi-band-imaging-survey-for-high-alpha-planets/">MISHAPS</a> (The Multi-band Imaging Survey for High-Alpha PlanetS) and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014hst..prop13739S/abstract">ISLAndS</a> (Initial Star formation and Lifetimes of Andromeda Satellites) among them. But I am also involved in smaller ones that focus on galactic-archeology and on the study and characterization of variable stars in the Local Group galaxies and stellar clusters.
